Hi Michael

The issue with leaf images appears because these images are not present in the initial HTML response. Images are created programmatically.

Website transforms relative image URLs by adding a Hippo CMS domain prefix. In this case it would be https://api-content-uat1.test.travisperkins.co.uk/site/ms/trade-corner-calendar/summer/static_assets/leaf.svg<https://api-content-uat1.test.travisperkins.co.uk/site/ms/trade-corner-calendar/summer/static_assets/leaf.svg>

In order to fix the issue you may:
- Add these images to the index.html file. In this case website would automatically transform URLs
or
- Create a URL programmatically by adding prefix. Keep in mind that this prefix would be different for staging and production environments.
   UAT - https://api-content-uat1.test.travisperkins.co.uk/site/ms/trade-corner-calendar/summer/static_assets/leaf.svg<https://api-content-uat1.test.travisperkins.co.uk/site/ms/trade-corner-calendar/summer/static_assets/leaf.svg>

   Hi Michael

   You may unpublish it. But it is not necessary, as it was published on the UAT environment

   Thanks,

      Hi Michael

      We may release to production microsite integration code if there is no issue with the integration itself.
      It would not automatically publish new microsite pages. It would just give you the possibility to publish new microsite pages when bundles are ready.
      Do you have any concerns?

      Thanks,
      Nikita

         We will take this to CHC and revert. For the time-being can we not release to production. Hopefully we will have fixed the issues in time for next week’s release.

            If you mean scrolling on the microsite page - it is controlled by the microsite bundle. Website scripts do not affect anything on this page

               I’ll get back to you but there are some issues that we need to fix. We have reached out to CHC digital to see if this is an issue with the bundle.



               I don’t know if you spotted that the scrolling behaviour isn’t working as expected? Can you confirm whether this an issue that needs fixing your end or with CHC Digital (providers of the creative)?

                        Hi all

                        UAT closed environment is deployed, you may find published microsite using next steps:
                        1. Switch to a closed UAT environment by visiting https://www-uat2.dev.travisperkins.co.uk/closed<https://www-uat2.dev.travisperkins.co.uk/closed> link
                        2. Visit microsite page link https://www-uat2.dev.travisperkins.co.uk/trade-corner/gardening-calendar/summer<https://www-uat2.dev.travisperkins.co.uk/trade-corner/gardening-calendar/summer>

                        Please keep in mind that the microsite bundle archive should have an index.html file at the root level. I have reuploaded the archive with this fix.

                                 We had some trouble this morning uploading the bundle to hippo CMS. Would you be on hand for 12pm BST to run us through it.

                                 FYI - we haven’t got the field to select the microsite type when uploading so this may be the issue.
